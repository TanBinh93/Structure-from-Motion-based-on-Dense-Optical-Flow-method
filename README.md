# Computation of homologous point groups usable as input by any SfM approach
Here is the MATLAB code for determining the homologous point groups (point tracks) usable as input of Structure from Motion (SfM). We proposed a Dense Optical Fow-based SfM to deal with the scenes with few textures, structures and images acquired under strong illumination changes.
# The Code tested on MATLAB R2018a 
# The parameters for Optical Flow and point grouping can be seen in file Readme
